# HardLearning
Hey there.
In this repos, there's a bunch of different code challenges mixed in.
The name might be confusing yes, but, it came up when i decidedly seated and told myself that i should challenge me with
something from JS knowledge i had. 
That time when i couldn't really fugure out how the conditional statement works.
Learnig process.

Leave a comment bellow for anything that you might have noticed to do better. 
Thank you.
